# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section2/exercises/methods.rb`

# Example: Write a method that when called will print your name:
def print_name
  p "Severus Snape"
end

print_name

# Write a method that takes a name as an argument and prints it:
def print_name(name)
  # YOUR CODE HERE
  # name = gets.chomp
  p name
end
print_name("Albus Dumbledore")

# Write a method that takes in 2 numbers as arguments and prints
# their sum. Then call your method three times with different arguments passed in:
# YOUR CODE HERE
def my_sum(x,y)
  p x + y
end
my_sum(2,3)
my_sum(5,4)
my_sum(1,-2)
# Write a method that takes in two strings as arguments and prints
# a concatenation of those two strings. Example: The arguments could be
# (man, woman) and the end result might output: "When Harry Met Sally".
# Then call your method three times with different arguments passed in.
def duo(thing1,thing2)
  p "I now pronounce you #{thing1} and #{thing2}"
end
duo("Chuck","Larry")
duo("Eric", "Zoey Deschanel")
duo("bert", "ernie")

# PART 3: Naming is Hard
#-------------------


# Naming is notoriously hard in programming. It is a skill to name a variable or function concisely enough that it is reasonable to type, but descriptive enough that others can infer the meaning.

# Look at the code you wrote for the previous YOU DOðŸŽˆ - what did you name the function, and why?
# What did you name each parameter, and why?

# EXPLAIN:
#I named the fucntion Duo since it takes in 2 arguments which I wanted to be a couple/pair
# I named each parameter thing1 and thing2 based off the Dr. Seuss characters and they can be used to refer to a couple/pair as well
