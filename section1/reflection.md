## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
As a math tutor, I really resonate with the "the best way to learn is to teach and help others. I also strongly agree/knew that practicing is the best way to learn something. However, the first part of the article that mentions reading is also a great way to learn something is something I agree with, but I'm not the best at reading. But I'm willing to put in the effort!
I would add that explaining things in different ways is another way to really solidify your learning. Really reinforces your knowledge.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
p "Hello World"
or
puts "Hello World"
1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
# octothorpe, pound sign, or hash symbol
1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
an integer is a whole number and a float is a number with a decimal.

animal = "zebra"
1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
p animal
1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
interpolation is using variables in a string that will get substituted with the variable values
p "a type animal is #{animal}"
1. What method is used to get input from a user?

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
